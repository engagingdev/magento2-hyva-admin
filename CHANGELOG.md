### Changed
- Bugfix: modules enabled in app/etc/config.php but not installed no longer throw an exception.  
  Thanks to [Mirko Cesaro](https://github.com/hyva-themes/magento2-hyva-admin/issues/53) for reporting!
  
- Bugfix: grid sources with an accessor methods starting with `is` (e.g. `isActive`) no longer always 
  return `null` if the object also implements magic getters.
  
- Bugfix: for ajax grids, grid action URLs with `*` as part of the new path will now resolve to the original route instead of using the ajax route.
  This closes the issue #56.
  
- Use TailwindCSS forms plugin strategy `class`. This will improve compatibility with
  existing Magento forms. Some modules that relied on the automatic form styles resets might need to be updated.
